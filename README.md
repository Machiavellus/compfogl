<<<<<<< HEAD

CONFIG DOES NOT SEEM TO LOAD confogl.cfg. loading compfogl provides shotgun with default ammo, no pills upon leaving saferoom, hr spawns without limits. no idea why. investigate. had problem before with 2v2 config that randomly resolved itself.
=======
- Smokers and hunters now have continuous damage ticks similar to jockeys.
- Infected Ghost Hurt protection is now removed when the round goes live, meaning you can sack spawns while survivors are in saferoom after RUP.
