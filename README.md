========
Competitive L4D2 Config


- AWP will spawn in place of the Hunting Rifle.
- While holding the AWP, you will move 10% slower.
- An M16 that is a complete mid-ground between SMG and SUZI is added for variety.
- Up to 3 pills and 1 adrenaline can spawn on the map.
- Machine guns (Including the M16) do 90% damage to tank and are limited to two.
- The tank is ten units faster than the survivors.
- Smokers tongues pull faster and require more precise reaction time to shut down. 
- Smoker drag damage reduced from 3 to 2.
- Smoker choke damage per second increased from 5 to 6.5.
- Smoker tongues are a bit harder to juke behind poles and similar obstacles.
- The pumpshotgun has had it's spread slightly decreased to make it more on par with the chrome shotgun.
- Smokers health increased to 275.
- Dark Carnival 4 "Moustachio" Horde completely removed.
- Infected M2 ghost warp disabled.
- Blocked 3 exploit jumps on Death Toll 3 which allowed survivors to get past the train car choke faster.
- Smokers and hunters now have continuous damage ticks similar to jockeys.
- Infected Ghost Hurt protection is now removed when the round goes live, meaning you can sack spawns while survivors are in saferoom after RUP.

CONFIG DOES NOT SEEM TO LOAD confogl.cfg. loading compfogl provides shotgun with default ammo, no pills upon leaving saferoom, hr spawns without limits. no idea why. investigate. had problem before with 2v2 config that randomly resolved itself.
